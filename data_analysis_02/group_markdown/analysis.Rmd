## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Q: is there a geographic concentration of monuments in any particular area of California?  
# A: There is not — the monuments are spread out across several counties in different parts of California (some are more inland, some coastal, some in the north and others in the south)

##How many monuments in Cali have come down? When were they taken down — before/after Floyd?

# part 2: When were they taken down — before/after Floyd?
cali_monuments_down_bf_floyd <- cali_monuments_down %>%
  filter(year_removed < 2020,) %>%
  arrange(desc(year_removed))
 
cali_monuments_down_bf_floyd

# Before Floyd: *5 (see answer below for reasoning behind "*"). two in 2016, and one in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

cali_monuments_down_af_floyd <- cali_monuments_down %>%
  filter(year_removed >= 2020) %>%
  arrange(desc(year_removed))
 
cali_monuments_down_af_floyd

# After Floyd: *1, in 2020. George Floyd was killed in 2020 and only one monument was removed/renamed in that year. Floyd was killed in the spring, so it's possible that this monument was taken down prior to his death, but given the large-scale removal of confederate monuments in the wake of his death, it's more likely that this monument was taken down in reaction to the tragedy and unrest that followed. 
# Essentially, we know one was removed in 2020, but we have to consult other data to glean the exact date in 2020 to see if it was before or after George Floyd was slain.
